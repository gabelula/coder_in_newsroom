- And journalism needs more diversity in voices. The same as with technology
- Journalism And Technology are shaping the world
  - journalism shape how we view the world
- Something about Future of Journalism  in Community
- My story with journalism started with community and independent media. In Uruguay I was participating in my neighborhood community radio
- In 2001 there was a big economic crisis in Uruguay and Argentina. The traditional media was not showing what we were seeing was happening in the streets. There was the need for a media that we could trust. We started to make media in the internet and came up with the motto "everybody is a journalist". The idea that journalism feeds from the community that it serves.
- With that experience in mind I came to be very very excited about the work that The Coral Project is doing to put in the table a discussion on how we integrate the readers into the journalism that is made in the newsrooms

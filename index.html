					<h1>Coders in the Newsroom</h1>

						There is usually programmers and other technical professionals working in the newsrooms, maintaining the servers and designing the website.

					<h1>How did I arrive to Journalism?</h1>
					<h2>Not trusting "traditional media"</h2>
					<h3>through community and independent media and activism</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						- In 2001 there was a big economic crisis in Uruguay and Argentina.
						The traditional media was not showing what we were seeing was happening in the streets.
						There was the need for a media that we could trust. We started to make media in the internet
						and came up with the motto "everybody is a journalist". The idea that journalism feeds from
						the community that it serves.
						- Mozilla Open News
						- With that experience in mind I came to be very very excited about the work that The Coral Project is doing to put in the table a discussion on how we integrate the readers into the journalism that is made in the newsrooms
